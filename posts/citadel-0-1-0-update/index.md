In this blog post, I want to share a few more details regarding Citadel 0.1.0.

I myself haven't had much time to focus on Citadel recently, but I'm now trying to spend more time on it.

There have been a few things delaying Citadel 0.1.0, so I just wanted to share this quick update with you.

### Citadel CLI

This is a thing I forgot in our anniversary blog post: 0.1.0 will also include the Citadel CLI built by [Phil](https://github.com/pwltr).

This will make interacting with your node via SSH much easier, and will also be useful for people new to Linux to get started with the CLI easier.

### What's causing the delays?

We want Citadel 0.1.0 to be a better release than what we had done previously.

For this reason, we want to spend a lot time on ensuring these things:

- Bug-free: Code should be tested better
- Developer Experience: Developing apps for Citadel should be easy, porting apps from Umbrel should be able to happen in 5 minutes
- User experience: Citadel should be easy to use and fast

To ensure these things, and also bring new features to you, Citadel 0.1.0 takes a bit longer to develop.

We're currently redesigning the Citadel app system completely for a better user and developer experience. To make sure this new system will last longer than the previous one, we need to spend a lot of time on optimizing it and trying out various options on how apps could be developed.

But don't worry, we're still preparing the release, and a beta version will be published soon.
